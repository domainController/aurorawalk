===============================================================
int main – ‘int main’ means that our function needs to return some integer at the end of the execution and we do so by returning 0 at the end of the program. 0 is the standard for the “successful execution of the program”.
==================================================================
main() is the entry point of C/C++ application. If you use int main() , It will return integer value as return. If you use void main() , then this will not return anything
